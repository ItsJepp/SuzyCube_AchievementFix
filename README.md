# Suzy Cube Achievement Fix
A MelonLoader mod that fixes the "Special Star Stuff" achievement in "Suzy Cube".

## Installation Instructions
1. Download and run [MelonLoader.Installer.exe](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest)
2. Select the game executable `<steamapps folder>/common/Please Don't Touch Anything 3D/PDTA 3D.exe` to install MelonLoader
    * **NOTE:** You MAY need to change the MelonLoader version to v0.5.7 before pressing INSTALL
3. Download [SuzyCube_AchievementFix.dll](https://github.com/ItsJepp/SuzyCube_AchievementFix/releases/latest) and place into the new `Mods` folder in the game directory

### OPTIONAL
If you've lost your progress but have unlocked achievements previously, you can also install the ProgressFromAchievements mod to unlock and star levels you already have the achievements for.
If you've completed all worlds, it will also unlock and star all but one of the bonus levels.
1. Follow the above installation instructions
2. Download [SuzyCube_ProgressFromAchievements.dll](https://github.com/ItsJepp/SuzyCube_AchievementFix/releases/latest) and place into the `Mods` folder in the game directory
3. Once in game, click the new button on the main menu to create a save file based on your unlocked achievements

## Troubleshooting
### I can't run MelonLoader
MelonLoader has some requirements which you can find in the [requirements](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README?id=requirements) section of their documentation.

### The mod doesn't work or crashes the game
The mod was created and tested using MelonLoader **v0.5.7** - if it's not working with other versions, try reinstalling MelonLoader **v0.5.7**.

### The ProgressFromAchievements button doesn't do anything
The mod requires a blank save slot, so if all three are full you will need to clear one of them before hitting the button.

### Something else
Feel free to leave an issue or get in touch if you run into any problems!
